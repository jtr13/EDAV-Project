EDAV Project

This is the EDAV Project for Jialei Wang, Xiaoxin Xu and Ruxin Shen.
The goal of our project is to perform an analysis on living conditions of single people. Through the analysis, we are aiming at answering these questions: 
1. How depressed the single population are?
2. What might cause them to be depressed.
3. Are some of these factors related? 
4. How can we help?
